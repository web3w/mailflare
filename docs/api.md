# API and integrations

Mailflare exposes APIs for domain management and sending email. Authentication and mailbox permissions still apply to these routes.

## Domain management

Adding or removing a domain from Mailflare also updates Cloudflare Email Routing and sending resources.

| Mailflare route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/domains` | List connected domains |
| `POST /api/domains` | Connect a domain and configure Cloudflare |
| `GET /api/domains/[id]` | Get a connected domain |
| `DELETE /api/domains/[id]` | Remove a domain and clean up its Cloudflare resources |
| `GET /api/domains/[id]/dns` | View its routing and sending DNS status |

The hostname must be the apex of a zone available to the configured Cloudflare credentials, or a subdomain of that zone. Creating a mailbox also creates the Cloudflare Email Routing rule that delivers its address to the `mailflare` Worker.

### Domain management over the API

The same operations are available to scripts through API keys with the `domains` scope, using `Authorization: Bearer <key>`:

| Mailflare route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/domains` | List connected domains with their DNS status |
| `POST /api/v1/domains` | Connect a domain and configure Cloudflare (`{ hostname, enableRouting?, enableSending?, replaceMxRecords? }`) |
| `GET /api/v1/domains/[id]` | Get a connected domain |
| `DELETE /api/v1/domains/[id]` | Remove a domain and clean up its Cloudflare resources |
| `GET /api/v1/domains/[id]/dns` | View its routing, sending and authentication DNS status |
| `POST /api/v1/domains/[id]/dns/setup` | Create a missing record (`{ record: "mx" \| "spf" \| "dkim" \| "dmarc" }`) |

`GET /api/v1/domains` returns `{ domains, dns }`, where `dns[id].auth` reports `ok` / `missing` / `unknown` for MX, SPF, DKIM and DMARC. `GET /api/v1/domains/[id]/dns` returns the full audit, including the names queried and the values found. The `setup` route provisions MX/SPF through Email Routing, DKIM through the sending subdomain, and a `v=DMARC1; p=none` TXT for DMARC; on a self-hosted install where DNS is managed manually it returns an error, since Mailflare cannot write the zone.

## Sending email

Send email through `POST /api/v1/send`. `to`, `cc` and `bcc` accept either a comma-separated header string or an array of addresses; each entry may carry a display name (`"Maya Chen" <maya@example.net>`). A message can reach up to 50 recipients across the three fields. Attachments are optional and use Base64-encoded content:

```json
{
  "from": "support@example.com",
  "to": ["user@example.net", "\"Maya Chen\" <maya@example.net>"],
  "cc": "ops@example.com",
  "bcc": ["audit@example.com"],
  "subject": "Report",
  "text": "Attached.",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "filename": "report.pdf",
      "type": "application/pdf",
      "contentBase64": "<base64 data>"
    }
  ]
}
```

To send a reply that threads correctly in the recipient's client, pass the parent's Message-ID as `inReplyTo` and its chain as `references` (a header string or an array). Mailflare writes the `In-Reply-To` and `References` headers, files the sent copy in the same conversation, and stores `threadId`, `inReplyTo` and `references` on every message.

```json
{
  "from": "support@example.com",
  "to": "user@example.net",
  "subject": "Re: Report",
  "text": "Thanks, received.",
  "inReplyTo": "<CAF1abc@mail.example.net>",
  "references": ["<CAF0root@mail.example.net>", "<CAF1abc@mail.example.net>"]
}
```

`GET /api/messages/{id}/thread` (session auth) returns every stored message in the same conversation, oldest first, excluding drafts and trash. `GET /api/messages?group=thread` collapses a list to one row per conversation (its newest message matching the filter) and adds `threadCount`, `threadUnread` and `threadMessageIds`, the ids that row stands for within the current filter, so bulk actions can act on the whole conversation.

Messages composed in Mailflare are sent as HTML with a plain-text alternative derived from it. Quoted or forwarded content is wrapped in `<div class="mailflare-quote" data-mailflare-quote="1">` so the reader can fold it. `POST /api/drafts` accepts `forwardOfMessageId`, which copies that message's attachments onto the new draft; `DELETE /api/drafts/{id}/attachments/{attachmentId}` removes one, and `POST /api/send` with `draftId` sends the draft's stored files along with any uploaded in the request.

The dashboard composer accepts up to 10 attachments, with a 10 MB limit per file and a 20 MB combined limit. Attachment metadata is stored in D1 and file content is stored in R2. Downloads require access to the mailbox containing the message.

## JMAP

Mailflare serves [JMAP](https://jmap.io) (RFC 8620 core and RFC 8621 mail, plus submission) so external mail apps can read and send mail. Discovery is at `/.well-known/jmap`, which redirects to `/jmap/session`. Authenticate with an API key that has the `jmap` scope, either as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or as the password of HTTP Basic auth (the username is ignored). Settings > Account > Email apps mints such a key.

The account id is the user id. Each Mailflare mailbox appears as a top-level JMAP Mailbox with system children (`inbox`, `drafts`, `sent`, `archive`, `junk`, `trash`) and one child per user folder; a message belongs to exactly one of them. Supported methods: `Mailbox/get|query|set` (folders only), `Thread/get`, `Email/get|query|set|import`, `SearchSnippet/get`, `Identity/get`, `EmailSubmission/set`, and `Core/echo`. `Email/copy` and `Email/parse` are not implemented. `*/changes` return `cannotCalculateChanges`, so clients re-query on a state change; `/jmap/eventsource` pushes state changes by polling. `Email/set` creates drafts, updates `$seen` and `$flagged`, moves between mailboxes, and destroys (to Trash first, then permanently). `EmailSubmission/set` sends a draft and reports it destroyed, since the sent copy is a new message. Blob download and upload follow the Session's `downloadUrl` and `uploadUrl`.

`Email/import` takes a `message/rfc822` blob that was uploaded first and stores it as a draft, which is how clients that compose MIME themselves send: upload, import, then `EmailSubmission/set`. Each entry takes `blobId`, `mailboxIds`, and optionally `keywords` and `receivedAt`. **The target must be exactly one Drafts mailbox** — importing into Inbox or a folder is rejected with `invalidProperties` on `mailboxIds`, because delivered mail belongs to the inbound pipeline that does threading and spam scoring. `$seen` and `$flagged` are stored, `$draft` is implied, and other keywords are ignored. `receivedAt` sets the message date, falling back to the `Date` header and then to now. The uploaded bytes are kept verbatim, so downloading the new message's `blobId` returns exactly what was uploaded rather than a reconstruction, and the `Message-ID` header is stored so the client can find its own draft again. Per-message failures come back in `notCreated` as `blobNotFound`, `invalidEmail`, `invalidProperties`, `forbidden` (the `From` address is not one the key may send from) or `tooLarge`.

`Email/query` supports the `header` filter: `["Message-ID", "<id@example.com>"]` matches messages with that value, and `["Message-ID"]` matches any message that has the header. `Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To` and `References` are answered from stored columns; Message-IDs compare with or without angle brackets, and header names are case-insensitive. Any other header name returns an `unsupportedFilter` error rather than silently matching everything.

## Password reset and two-factor authentication

`POST /api/auth/password-reset/request` with `{ email }` always answers `200 { ok: true }`; when the account exists and has a recovery email, a single-use link valid for 30 minutes is mailed there. `POST /api/auth/password-reset/confirm` with `{ token, password }` sets the password and signs the account out everywhere.

When two-factor authentication is on, `POST /api/auth/login` returns `{ ok: true, mfaRequired: true, challengeToken }` instead of a session. `POST /api/auth/mfa/verify` with `{ challengeToken, code }` completes the sign-in; `code` is a 6-digit TOTP or one of the recovery codes. Challenges expire after 5 minutes. Enrolment, recovery codes and turning it off are under `/api/settings/mfa/*` (session auth) and always re-check the password.

## Searching

`GET /api/messages?q=...` (session) and `GET /api/v1/messages?q=...` (API key, `read` scope) accept the same query grammar, backed by an FTS5 index over subject, sender, recipients and body:

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `invoice` | prefix match anywhere (`inv` finds "invoice") |
| `"private window"` | exact phrase |
| `-word` | exclude |
| `from:maya`, `to:sam`, `subject:report` | restrict a term to one field (`to:` covers Cc) |
| `has:attachment` | at least one non-inline attachment |
| `is:unread`, `is:read`, `is:starred` | flags |
| `after:2026-09-01`, `before:2026-09-30` | date bounds (UTC, `before` exclusive) |

Terms combine with AND. Admins can check or rebuild the index with `GET` / `POST /api/admin/search-index`; triggers keep it current, so a rebuild is only needed after restoring a backup made before the index existed.

## Real-time updates

Mailflare uses a Durable Object WebSocket hub to notify connected users after an inbound message is stored. Mailbox owners, the domain administrator, and delegated users receive events for mailboxes they can access.

The `REALTIME` binding and its migration are declared in `wrangler.jsonc`. When a WebSocket is temporarily unavailable, the app retries the connection and uses a slower refresh until it recovers.
